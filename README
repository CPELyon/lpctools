LPCTools is an interface to NXP LPC Microcontrollers ISP (In-System
Programming) serial interface.

It is split in two programms: lpcisp and lpcprog

* lpcisp:
This tool gives access to each of the usefull isp commands on LPC
devices. It does not provide wrappers for flashing a device.

* lpcprog:
This tool does not give access to each isp command, instead it
provides wrappers for flashing a device.

Both programms were originally written by Nathael Pajani
<nathael.pajani@nathael.net> because existing programms were published
under non-free licences, did not allow comercial use, or did not
provide source code.

This programm is released under the terms of the GNU GPLv3 licence
as can be found on the GNU website : <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>
or in the included LICENCE file.


********************
TODO :

Allow reading of parts information in a separate file (modify parts.c)
to enable easy definition of new parts.

Allow flashing of parts with flash sectors of different sizes (LPC1764
has 16 small 4k sectors and two big 32k sectors).

Add the definition of all LPC parts ?
