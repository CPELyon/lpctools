LPCTools is an interface to NXP LPC Microcontrollers ISP (In-System
Programming) serial interface.

It is split in two programs: lpcisp and lpcprog

* lpcisp:
This tool gives access to each of the useful isp commands on LPC
devices. It does not provide wrappers for flashing a device.

* lpcprog:
This tool does not give access to each isp command, instead it
provides wrappers for flashing a device.

Both programs were originally written by Nathael Pajani
<nathael.pajani@nathael.net> because existing programs were published
under non-free licences, did not allow comercial use, or did not
provide source code.

* lpc_binary_check:
This third tool is an additionnal helper programm created to change the
user code and check that the CRP protection is not enabled in a binary
image so that it can be uploaded to a target with different tools.

These programs are released under the terms of the GNU GPLv3 licence
as can be found on the GNU website : <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>
or in the included LICENSE file.


********************
TODO :

Allow flashing of parts with flash sectors of different sizes (LPC1764
has 16 small 4k sectors and two big 32k sectors).
--> Need either to change parts definition format or to flash in two times.

Add the definition of all LPC parts ?
